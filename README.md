### Collected Metrics
This plugin has the ability to gather the following metrics:

Namespace | Description (optional)
----------|-----------------------


### Examples
Example running mysql, passthru processor, and writing data to a file.

This is done from the snap directory.

In one terminal window, open the snap daemon (in this case with logging set to 1 and trust disabled):
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapd -l 1 -t 0
```

In another terminal window:
Load mysql plugin
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load snap-plugin-collector-mysql
```
See available metrics for your system
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl metric list
```

Create a task manifest file (e.g. `mem-file.json`):    
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "schedule": {
        "type": "simple",
        "interval": "1s"
    },
    "workflow": {
        "collect": {
            "metrics": {
                "/intel/mysql/threads/running": {},
                "/intel/mysql/mysql_commands/alter_tablespace": {},
                "/intel/mysql/operations/innodb_rwlock_s_spin_rounds": {}
            },
            "config": {},
            "process": null,
            "publish": [
                {
                    "plugin_name": "file",
                    "config": {
                        "file": "/tmp/published_mysql"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
Load file plugin for publishing:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load build/plugin/snap-publisher-file
Plugin loaded
Name: file
Version: 3
Type: publisher
